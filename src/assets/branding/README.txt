Initial Design:

Based on font https://www.dafont.com/singapore-sling.font which is licensed as free for non-commercial use.
Mixture of upper and lower case letters used to obtain desire base letters.
"V", "R", "A", and "D" modified. So we've in effect ended up with our own, unique font.

Color gradient:
- blue:   #01BDFF ; HLS = 196%, 50%, 100%
- violet: #8C1AFF ; HLS = 270%, 55%, 100%
